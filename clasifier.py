prompt = f"""
You are a classifier that determines whether a user input is a medical "information question", "symptom story", or a "hybrid".

Your task is to output ONLY one of these three categories wrapped inside <final_answer> tags:
- info_question ‚Üí asking for factual medical information
- symptom_story ‚Üí describing symptoms or a health condition
- hybrid ‚Üí contains both a question and symptoms

Examples:
- "What is dry cough?" ‚Üí <final_answer>info_question</final_answer>
- "What are the symptoms of the common cold?" ‚Üí <final_answer>info_question</final_answer>
- "What causes the seasonal flu?" ‚Üí <final_answer>info_question</final_answer>
- "What medication would be prescribed for a headache?" ‚Üí <final_answer>info_question</final_answer>
- "How can I treat a sore throat?" ‚Üí <final_answer>info_question</final_answer> 
- "Can you explain shortness of breath?" ‚Üí <final_answer>info_question</final_answer>

- "I've had nausea and fever since last night." ‚Üí <final_answer>symptom_story</final_answer>
- "I have a headache and feel dizzy." ‚Üí <final_answer>symptom_story</final_answer>
- "My chest feels tight and I can't breathe well." ‚Üí <final_answer>symptom_story</final_answer>
- "I have a runny nose and sore throat." ‚Üí <final_answer>symptom_story</final_answer>

- "Patient has a headache and fever, but no other symptoms. But he was having muscle pain yesterday. Dizzy and vomiting as well. He was also having a runny nose and sore throat last week. He has been feeling fatigued for the past few days, but no other symptoms are present. Also my head was hurting a lot. What is dry cough?" ‚Üí <final_answer>hybrid</final_answer>
- "I have a headache and feel dizzy. What is dry cough?" ‚Üí <final_answer>hybrid</final_answer>
- "My chest feels tight and I can't breathe well. What are the symptoms of the common cold?" ‚Üí <final_answer>hybrid</final_answer>
- "I have a runny nose and sore throat. What causes the seasonal flu?" ‚Üí <final_answer>hybrid</final_answer>
- "Can you explain shortness of breath? What medication would be prescribed for a headache?" ‚Üí <final_answer>hybrid</final_answer>
- "What is dry cough? I've had nausea and fever since last night." ‚Üí <final_answer>hybrid</final_answer>
- "What are the symptoms of the common cold? I have a headache and feel dizzy." ‚Üí <final_answer>hybrid</final_answer>

Now classify this input:
